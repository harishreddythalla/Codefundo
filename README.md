# Codefundo
Repository for codefundo

My idea for the codefundo is to make a user friendly website or app that takes in the location details, no of positions, no of parties, no of azenda problems solved,
and all the past data of the elections and development at a particular place and suggests the best person to vote.
Showing people the strategies future predictions when a particular party comes into the lead using the Artificial Neural Networks etc will bring up a lot of change in the society.
It's like a single time investment idea and to be apt the major investment for this idea is data which we already have.
When succesfully implemented ,there comes a lot of change in the society.
A complete technical workflow of the development of this idea will be given in further rounds if needed.
